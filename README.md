#### Branches
master

This script is a wrapper for sc.exe which lets you do lock-down permissions around being able to Start/Stop & Modify a service (this is for a user/group which is NOT a local administrator)
For information on how sc.exe does this refer to: http://blogs.msmvps.com/erikr/2007/09/26/set-permissions-on-a-specific-service-windows/

TODO:
Powershell metadata for help is not working after script changed to a module
